This is Kingston's project on the Kepler Objects of Interest Dataset for the Coding School Summer Research Program 2022.

The Kepler Mission is a project to identify KOI's (Kepler Objects of Interest) in the habitable zones of different stars in order to find planets with the possibility of having liquid water on them. This is done by using the transit method, where many thousands of stars are monitored for their brightness. When something passes over a star, the brightness of the star slightly decreases, showing signs of a transit and that a planet is orbiting that star. From there, the KOI is tested to be a real transit-like event, and the size and temperature of the KOI and star are both calculated in order to determine if it is habitable.
The Kepler space telescope was retired in 2018 and the Kepler mission has been officially over ever since.


RESEARCH QUESTIONS:
* Why does a transit reduce brightness? Why does something passing between the star and the observer create a dip?
* What tests are done to ensure a KOI is actually a planet?
* How does the orbital period (or any of the other variables) help determine if the KOI is a planet or if it's in the habitable zone?
  + What trends can be found within the data that might help us identify planets or false positives?
* What are possible reasons that a KOI might end up being a false positive?
* How can the knowledge of habitable planets help us?
