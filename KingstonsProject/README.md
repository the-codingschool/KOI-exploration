This is Kingston's project on the Kepler Objects of Interest Dataset for the Coding School Summer Research Program 2022.

The Kepler Mission is a project to identify KOI's (Kepler Objects of Interest) in the habitable zones of different stars in order to find exoplanets with the possibility of having liquid water on them. This is done by using the transit method, where many thousands of stars are monitored for their brightness. When something passes over a star, the brightness of the star slightly decreases, showing signs of a transit and that a planet is orbiting that star. From there, the KOI is tested to be a real transit-like event, and the size and temperature of the KOI and star are both calculated in order to determine if it is habitable.
The Kepler space telescope was retired in 2018, but the search for exoplanets is still continuing with other missions and space telescopes such as TESS.


POTENTIAL RESEARCH QUESTIONS:
* Why does a transit reduce brightness? Why does something passing between the star and the observer create a dip?
* What tests are done to ensure a KOI is actually a planet?
* How does the orbital period (or any of the other variables) help determine if the KOI is a planet or if it's in the habitable zone?
* What trends can be found within the data that might help us identify planets or false positives?
* What are possible reasons that a KOI might end up being a false positive?
* How can the knowledge of habitable planets help us?
* How does the equilibrium temperature affect the KOI's disposition?
* How does the transit duration (or other variables) of CANDIDATE KOIs differ compared to CANDIDATE KOIs with different disposition scores?
* What does the equilibrium temperature, transit duration, transit depth, orbital period, and stellar radius tell us about the radius of the planet?

* How does the planetary radius and stellar surface gravity affect the orbital period or transit duration?
  + How might the orbital periods of planets be affected differently by the planetary radius and stellar surface gravity depending on its equilibrium temperature? 

* What is the smallest combination of variables that will have the strongest correlation to the disposition?
  + What set of variables would lead to the strongest correlation to the disposition when using 1, 2, 3... up to all variables?



(Probably) FINAL RESEARCH QUESTION:
How might the orbital periods of planets be affected differently by the planetary radius and stellar surface gravity depending on its disposition?

Null hypothesis: The average orbital periods of planets will stay the same between different dispositions.

Alternate hypothesis: The average orbital periods of planets will differ between different dispositions.
