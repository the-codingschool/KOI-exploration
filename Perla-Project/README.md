Perla's project on the Kepler Objects of Interest Dataset for the Coding School Summer Research Program 2022.

Here are some Potential research questions:
1. What does orbital period have to do with being a candidate?
2. What variables play an important role in false positives? ***

Null/Alternate Hypothesis
1. Transit epoch, transit duration, transit depth, and transit signal-to-noise plays a role in exoplanet false positives.
2. Transit epoch, transit duration, transit depth, and transit signal-to-noise plays no role in exoplanet false positives.
